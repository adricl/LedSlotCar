# Led Slot Car
Written in Platform IO for the ESP32. 

## Game 

Initially this game was going to be where two light cars go around the track and if there was a bend you would have to slow down otherwise you would "crash" (by this it was going to blink). This was hard to demonstrate and sort of was a blocker to having a game that was fun/good.

So the new idea is to have 2 light cars going around the track trying to get a token on the track. This token would randomly spawn on the track and the aim would be to get to it ASAP.

A counter would show the score of each player.

The challenge would be from the controller as it's a large knob you can go forward and reverse with but due to the size of the knob it's not fast so reaction times are delayed.
